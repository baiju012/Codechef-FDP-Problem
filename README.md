Interview focused-- contest focused
monetary-- optional but powerful

CP Rating Levels
Beginner -- intermediate-- advanced
Codeforces Newbie--expert
codechef: 2*-- 4*


SDE sheet only for latest student like 3rd yar or those who started dealy to solve problem dsa
GFG 160


Why regular contests
Time pressure
dubugging under stress
Accepting 
Learning from failure
Upsolving after the contest is the way to increase rating most IMp

Faculty Role Motivation
Show Progress-- track students progress
Normalize struggle -- its okay everyone faces
Reward thinking appreciation 

Initial exposure Decides
first 2-3 weeks decide
interest
fear

Wrong way to start DSA
Definitions
Methematical proofs
Long lecture

Rignt way to start DSA
simple problems
thinking aloud
visual dry runs
student perticipation

A Broader view of learning DSA
DSA is not a list of topics 
it is a thinking progression


DSA Learing Framework
Part1--> cross Bridge--> parti2

Part 1 
in loop

part2 main problem
Recursion & Backtracking
 abstract thinking begins here
 Most students get stuck here

 Part 2-- Advanced DSA
 Tree'
 Graphs 
 tries
 segment tree
 Dynamic programming

 Beginner loop 
 student repeat
 Arrays
 stack 
 Quaue

 FA

 How to master Recursion
 Trees
 Graphs
 DP

 when shoudld studnets start CP

 after Arrays
 after binary search
 after basic recursion
 Not after completing DSA

 How much DSA before CP
 Enough to 
 understand constraints
 v\avoid brute force
 code confidently

 DSA and CP run parallel

 Why students know DSA but can't solve problems
 Memorization over thinking 
 solution first approach 
 No struggle



 Teaching VS Training
 Expalin concepts --- Build habits
 exam--- interview

 Redesigning Assignments
 Fewer problems
 Multiple approaches
 logic explanation mandatory
 Reading top submissions and understanding 
 Each topic, classroom problem-> Hw problem--> Practice problem

 Redesigning Labs
 TImed Problems
 no internt initially 
 Dry runns 7 edge cases






 

Redesigning Evaluations
Why this approach
why not brute force
what are edge cases
evaluate studnet on timely 

DSA is not a subject 
it is skill
